# TridUI Frontend

This is the frontend application for TridUI, built using SvelteKit and DaisyUI (and Tailwind CSS). It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the TridUI backend services.

> [!NOTE]
> Use `wails dev` from the root of the TridUI project to run both the frontend and backend together during development.

## Setup
